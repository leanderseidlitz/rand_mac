* rand_mac
MAC addresses are constant, which makes you easily trackable when you are associated with e.g. a WLAN network.

Enable =rand_mac@wlan0.timer= to regularily change your MAC address when not connected. Works for Ethernet to!

Copy:
=rand_mac@.timer= -> =/etc/systemd/system=
=rand_mac@.service= -> =/etc/systemd/system=
=rand_mac.sh= -> =/usr/local/bin/rand_mac=
